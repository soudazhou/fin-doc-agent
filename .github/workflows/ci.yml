# CI — Lint & Test on Every PR
# =============================================================================
#
# Runs ruff (lint) and pytest (140+ unit tests) on every push to main
# and every pull request targeting main.
#
# No external services needed — all tests mock DB, Redis, and API calls.
# Uses uv for fast dependency installation with caching.
